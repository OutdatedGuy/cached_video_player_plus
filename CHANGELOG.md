**BREAKING CHANGES**

- Complete API restructure: `CachedVideoPlayerPlusController` replaced with class-based `CachedVideoPlayerPlus` approach
- Widget usage changed: Use `VideoPlayer(player.controller)` instead of `CachedVideoPlayerPlus(controller)`
- Controller access: Video control methods now accessed through `.controller` property (e.g., `player.controller.play()`)
- Storage migration: Switched from `get_storage` to `shared_preferences` for cache metadata storage
- Method renames: `removeCurrentFileFromCache()` ‚Üí `removeFromCache()`
- Parameter type changes: `removeFileFromCache()` now takes `Uri` instead of `String`
- Cache key prefix changed internally (handled automatically by migration utility)
- Default cache duration increased from 30 days to 69 days _(Nice! üòé)_
- Removed deprecated `CachedVideoPlayerPlusController.network()` constructor
- Removed classes: `CachedVideoPlayerPlusValue`, `CachedVideoPlayerPlus` widget, `ClosedCaptionFile` implementations

**Features**

- feat: Pre-cache videos without creating player instances using `CachedVideoPlayerPlus.preCacheVideo()`
- feat: Custom cache key support via `cacheKey` parameter for cleaner cache management _(because sometimes URLs are longer than a CVS receipt)_

- feat: Separate download headers via `downloadHeaders` parameter for authentication purposes
- feat: Cache removal by custom cache key using `removeFileFromCacheByKey()`
- feat: Automatic migration utility to preserve existing cached video data from v3.x.x
